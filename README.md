# Jujutsu Community

This organization serves as a place for sharing and discovering projects for and by the community 
around the VCS tool called "Jujutsu" or "jj".

We are distinct from jj, and inclusion of any given project is not an endorsement.

For an index of projects, see (TODO).

## Contributing

This organization is in its very early stages. Currently the flow is undefined. If you'd like to 
add a project to this organization, open an issue on our [Meta repo].

## Rules

These rules are temporary until we have sufficient enough governance structure to ratify rules 
that the community agrees on.

1. Make an attempt at giving all parties the benefit of the doubt. Giving others the chance to be
   kind makes it easier for them to give you the chance, which makes it easier to be kind overall.
2. No discrimination based on age, gender/sex, religion, ability, ethnicity/race, nationality, 
   appearance, or other similar characteristic. No discrimination based on politics, employment,
   or other membership, unless founded on said affiliation being discriminatory as per the previous
   list  
     a. Projects that include or endorse such content, or connect to third-
     parties that do so, are forbidden
3. Content, contributions, and aliases forbidden to contain, depict, or describe:
   - Overtly sexual themes
   - Physical or emotional harm
   - Intentionally inflammatory material
4. Organization leaders have final say on what constitutes a violation of the above rules

## Initial governance

All projects with good governance usually accept starting with a BDFL model to get the ball 
rolling. Governance of individual projects will be mostly left to themselves, aside from things 
dependent on their relationship to the org, but the org itself will have a core group that will
facilitate. The initial scope of the core group will be described in the [Meta repo].

Intentions as of this point:
- Ensure the state of projects is known
- Enable abandon projects to be adopted
- For stale/abandoned projects merge fixes on the [CVSS scale] of 8+
- Assist when possible (non-obligatory) to setup CI/etc
