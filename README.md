# Jujutsu Community

This organization serves as a place for sharing and discovering projects for and by the community 
around the VCS tool called "Jujutsu" or "jj".

We are distinct from jj, and inclusion of any given project is not an endorsement.

For an index of projects, see (TODO).

## Contributing

This organization is in its very early stages. Currently the flow is undefined. If you'd like to 
add a project to this organization, open an issue on [our Meta repo](https://github.com/jj-community/meta).

## Rules

TODO: The rules for this org should be extremely permissive, limiting to fairly standard Code of 
Conduct levels. Rules will apply to participation, projects, and topics that projects touch (eg
a tool that interacts with NeoNazi platform should be treated as an extension of that platform).
